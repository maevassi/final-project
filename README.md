# Checkmate Predictions

Chess is an abstract strategy game which involves no hidden information and no elements of chance. This project tries to predict if a game resulted in a black or white winner depending on the player level using a Chess Game Dataset with just over 20,000 games collected from a selection of users from the free open source chess server Lichess.org.
The original dataset has 16 variables, but the project will focus on four variables :

- Game status;
- Winner;
- White player rating; and
- Black player rating.
