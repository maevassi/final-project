# Checkmate Predictions

Chess is an abstract strategy game which involves no hidden information and no elements of chance. This project tries to predict if a game resulted in a black or white winner depending on the player level using a Chess Game Dataset with just over 20,000 games collected from a selection of users from the free open source chess server Lichess.org.
The original dataset has 16 variables, but the project will focus on four variables :

- - `rated`:	Rated (T/F), which is whether the game was a rated game (which will affect your rating in the platform), or a casual game.
- `victory_status`: Game status (mate, resign, draw, out of time);
- Winner (white, black);
- White player rating; and
- Black player rating.
